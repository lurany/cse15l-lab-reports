## TA Response:

The code that you have provided is correct and your expected output was that it should be able to run tests, however; it did not run, and 
here might be a reason why. I could see that you try to compile your files on the terminal, but thing about it is that it did compile right.
After compiling, you weren't supposed to add `.java` at the end of the file. When compiling, you were suppose to `javac` compile with `ArrayTests.java` 
or `*.java`, but after that, you were suppose to `java ArrayTests` excluding `.java`.




# Part 2 - Reflection 
Something I learn that was pretty helpful on the second half of the quarter was being able to utillize the keyboard
shortcuts, which were so much efficient. For example, if I wanted to delete just one word from the previous text, 
rather than hitting the `backspace` button multiple times, I can just hit `Ctrl-W` which would delete the entire word. 
Thus, saving more time. Not to mention, `Ctrl-A` allows you to go all the way back to beginning of the line, which 
saves a lot of time than hitting the `arrow` key.
