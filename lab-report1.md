# Step 1: setup cs15l account password
First, setup a password for your cs15l account by visiting ([sdacs.ucsd.edu](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php.)) Enter your username and password for 
your ucsd account and it should provide "cs15lsp23zz" with the last two letters representing your id.

# Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code
Install vscode by visiting [visualstudio](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Follow the instructions provided by the website and you should be able to install
vscode. Next, open vscode and it should look something like this:

# Step 3: Remotely Connecting 
If you're on windows, install git by visiting [git](https://gitforwindows.org/). Once installed, open vscode and change your default terminal to 
git bash. Open git bash terminal and enter: "ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu" with zz replaced by the specific id provided by you in step 1. 
If this is the first time you log in, you should receive a message asking if you want to continue, which you should type yes. Next, it'll ask 
you to enter a password, which is the same password you've created in step 1. After completing all these steps, your terminal should look something
like this:

# Step 4: Trying commands
On the terminal, try running some commands such as **cd ~**, **cd**, **ls -lat**, and **ls -a**. The output should be something like this:
